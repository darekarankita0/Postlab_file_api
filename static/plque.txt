If 1 means an object is detected and 0 meaning no object is detected, then considering the sensor is stationary, what can be said about the movement of the object if the output by the sensor is 1010101? What are the factors that affect the performance of the Ultrasonic Sensor during operation? List some Advance IOT projects? Mostly used protocols in IOT?\"}"
